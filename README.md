## League Matches

Scaffolding and boilerplate provided by: https://github.com/Arieg419/ElectronReactBoilerplate


This will be an electron application that lives in the status bar / tray of your desktop
that brings up League of Legends match schedules and results for the week.

Match data provided by the PandaScore API.



TODO:
- Get the official Riot colors / design to use in React
- Create API
- Make static components

NOTE: 
- Might have to create a simple webapp that I would use to manage the API requests to PandaScore to 
keep my secret key... secret :D
- Solution: https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-JS
